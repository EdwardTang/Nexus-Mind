# Vector Store Layer Design Document

## Overview

The Vector Store Layer is a critical component of the Nexus-Mind distributed vector database, responsible for efficiently storing, retrieving, and searching high-dimensional vector embeddings. This layer builds upon the distributed foundation provided by the Raft consensus implementation and extends the key-value storage capabilities to support vector-specific operations.

## Design Goals

1. **High-Performance Vector Operations**: Implement efficient similarity search with sub-linear time complexity
2. **Scalable Storage**: Support billions of vectors across distributed nodes
3. **Flexible Distance Metrics**: Support multiple similarity measures (cosine, dot product, Euclidean)
4. **Persistence**: Reliable storage and recovery of vector data
5. **Integration with Existing Architecture**: Seamless integration with the Raft consensus layer

## Component Architecture

### 1. Vector Data Types

### 2. HNSW Index Implementation

The Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algorithm provides efficient approximate nearest neighbor search with logarithmic complexity:

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│       HNSW Index        │
├─────────────────────────┤
│ - Multi-layer graph     │
│ - Navigable small world │
│ - Entry points          │
│ - Node connections      │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

Key characteristics:
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Multiple layers with decreasing density
- **Small World Properties**: Short graph distances between nodes
- **Logarithmic Search Time**: O(log N) complexity for query operations
- **Incremental Construction**: Support for dynamic updates

Implementation details:
- **Concurrency Model**: Reader-writer locks for each layer with fine-grained locking
  - Read operations can proceed in parallel (multiple concurrent searches)
  - Write operations acquire layer-specific locks to modify connections
  - Copy-on-write for batch modifications to minimize lock contention
- **Deletion Strategy**: Lazy deletion with periodic cleanup
  - Deleted nodes marked but kept in graph structure initially
  - Background process periodically rebuilds affected regions
  - Deletion counter triggers compaction when threshold reached
- **Batch Operations**: Optimized bulk insertion algorithm
  - Parallel construction of connection candidates
  - Efficient linking of multiple vectors in one operation
  - Specialized bulk load for initial dataset ingestion

Configuration parameters:
- `M`: Maximum number of connections per node (default: 16)
- `efConstruction`: Size of dynamic candidate list during construction (default: 200)
- `efSearch`: Size of dynamic candidate list during search (default: 100)
- `maxLayer`: Maximum layer in the hierarchy (auto-calculated based on data size)

### 3. Storage Manager

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│    Storage Manager      │
├─────────────────────────┤
│ - Vector serialization  │
│ - Index persistence     │
│ - Backup/recovery       │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

Responsibilities:
- Efficient binary serialization of vector data

- Incremental backup capability
- Recovery from disk or distributed replicas

Implementation details:
- **File Structure**:
  - `vectors.data`: Sequential vector storage with fixed-size headers and variable metadata
  - `hnsw_layers/`: Directory containing separate files for each HNSW layer
  - `metadata_index/`: B-tree indexes for metadata fields
  - `manifest.json`: Configuration and version information

- **Snapshot Strategy**:
  - Full snapshot: Complete copy of all data structures
  - Incremental snapshot: Delta changes since last snapshot with operation log
  - Partition-level snapshots: Independent backup of each shard
  - Version markers for consistency across files

- **Memory Mapping**:
  - Memory-mapped vector data for efficient random access
  - Configurable cache size for frequently accessed vectors
  - Separate buffer pool for index structures

- **Compaction**:
  - Background process to reclaim space from deleted vectors

  - Rebuilds affected index regions during low-load periods

### 4. Distance Calculators

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│   Distance Calculators  │
├─────────────────────────┤
│ - Cosine similarity     │
│ - Dot product           │

  - Progressive refinement during search

### 5. Integration with Raft State Machine

The Vector Store Layer extends the existing key-value store state machine to support vector operations:

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  Extended State Machine │
├─────────────────────────┤
│ - Vector commands       │
│ - Index management      │
│ - Replication handling  │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

Command extensions:
- `VectorPut`: Store new vector or update existing one
- `VectorGet`: Retrieve vector by ID
- `VectorSearch`: Find K nearest neighbors
- `VectorDelete`: Remove vector from storage (soft delete)
- `VectorBatchPut`: Insert multiple vectors in one operation
- `CollectionCreate`: Initialize a new vector collection
- `CollectionDelete`: Remove a vector collection

Optimizations:
- **Command Batching**: Group multiple vector operations into single Raft entries
- **Read-Only Operations**: Direct local execution for search operations (non-consensus)
- **State Snapshots**: Efficient serialization of vector collections and indices

## Query API & Search Strategies

The Vector Store Layer implements a unified Query API for all types of vector search and retrieval operations, inspired by modern vector databases like Qdrant. The API supports various search strategies and methods depending on the query parameters, adapting to different use cases and performance requirements.

### Universal Query Types

Our Query API supports multiple search methods through a single unified interface:

```go
// QueryRequest encapsulates all possible query types
type QueryRequest struct {
    // One of the following must be specified
    Vector       []float32         // Vector search (kNN)
    PointID      string            // Search by existing point ID
    Recommend    *RecommendParams  // Recommendation by examples
    Scroll       *ScrollParams     // Pagination through all points
    Sample       string            // Random sampling ("random")
    
    // Optional parameters
    Filter       *MetadataFilter   // Filtering conditions
    Params       *SearchParams     // Search behavior configuration
    Limit        int               // Maximum results to return
    Offset       int               // Number of results to skip
    WithVectors  bool              // Include vectors in response
    WithPayload  interface{}       // Control payload inclusion
    
    // Grouping parameters
    GroupBy      string            // Field to group results by
    GroupSize    int               // Maximum points per group
    GroupLimit   int               // Maximum groups to return
    
    // For multi-vector collections
    Using        string            // Which vector field to use
}
```

#### 1. Nearest Neighbors Search (kNN)

Standard vector similarity search, finding the k nearest neighbors to a query vector:

```go
results, err := collection.Query(&QueryRequest{
    Vector: queryVector,
    Limit: 10,
})
```

#### 2. Search By ID

Search using an existing vector as the query, avoiding the need to provide an external vector:

```go
results, err := collection.Query(&QueryRequest{
    PointID: "43cf51e2-8777-4f52-bc74-c2cbde0c8b04",
    Limit: 10,
})
```

#### 3. Recommendations

Find similar vectors based on positive and negative examples:

```go
results, err := collection.Query(&QueryRequest{
    Recommend: &RecommendParams{
        Positive: []string{"id1", "id2"},
        Negative: []string{"id3"},
    },
    Limit: 10,
})
```

#### 4. Scrolling

Paginate through all vectors in a collection with optional filtering:

```go
results, err := collection.Query(&QueryRequest{
    Scroll: &ScrollParams{
        Offset: "0",
        Limit: 100,
    },
    Filter: someFilter,
})
```

#### 5. Random Sampling

Get a random sample of vectors from the collection:

```go
results, err := collection.Query(&QueryRequest{
    Sample: "random",
    Limit: 10,
})
```

### Search Strategies & Parameters

The behavior of vector search can be fine-tuned using the `SearchParams` configuration, which controls the trade-off between speed and accuracy:

#### 1. Default Search

The default search strategy balances speed and accuracy:

- Uses HNSW index with moderate `ef` parameter (100)
- Performs exact distance calculations on candidate set
- Applies metadata filtering after vector search
- Suitable for most general-purpose searches

```go
results, err := collection.Query(&QueryRequest{
    Vector: queryVector,
    Limit: 10,
    Params: &SearchParams{
        Strategy: Default,
    },
})
```

#### 2. Exact Search

For cases requiring perfect recall or when the dataset is small:

- Bypasses HNSW index entirely
- Performs brute-force comparison against all vectors
- Guarantees optimal results but significantly slower
- Primarily used for testing, validation, or critical applications

```go
results, err := collection.Query(&QueryRequest{
    Vector: queryVector,
    Limit: 10,
    Params: &SearchParams{
        Strategy: ExactSearch,
        Exact: true,
    },
})
```

#### 3. Fast Search

Optimized for minimal latency at the cost of some accuracy:

- Uses HNSW with lower `ef` parameter (40)
- May employ early stopping techniques
- Implements aggressive pruning of search paths
- Useful for real-time applications or where speed is critical

```go
results, err := collection.Query(&QueryRequest{
    Vector: queryVector,
    Limit: 10,
    Params: &SearchParams{
        Strategy: FastSearch,
        HnswEf: 40,
    },
})
```

#### 4. Precise Search

Maximizes accuracy while still leveraging the index:

- Uses HNSW with higher `ef` parameter (300+)
- Explores more candidates during search
- May apply secondary re-ranking of results
- Suitable for applications requiring high precision

```go
results, err := collection.Query(&QueryRequest{
    Vector: queryVector,
    Limit: 10,
    Params: &SearchParams{
        Strategy: PreciseSearch,
        HnswEf: 300,
    },
})
```

#### 5. Batch Search

Optimized for throughput of multiple queries rather than latency of individual queries:

- Processes multiple vectors in parallel
- Shares computational resources efficiently
- Reduces per-query overhead
- Ideal for offline processing or bulk operations

```go
results, err := collection.BatchQuery([]QueryRequest{
    {Vector: queryVector1, Limit: 5, Params: &SearchParams{Strategy: FastSearch}},
    {Vector: queryVector2, Limit: 10, Params: &SearchParams{Strategy: PreciseSearch}},
})
```

### Advanced Features

#### Result Filtering by Score

Filter out results with similarity scores below a threshold:

```go
results, err := collection.Query(&QueryRequest{
    Vector: queryVector,
    Limit: 10,
    Params: &SearchParams{
        ScoreThreshold: 0.7,
    },
})
```

#### Result Grouping

Group results by a field in the metadata to avoid redundancy:

```go
results, err := collection.Query(&QueryRequest{
    Vector: queryVector,
    GroupBy: "document_id",
    GroupSize: 2,
    GroupLimit: 10,
})
```

Response format with grouping:

```go
type GroupedSearchResult struct {
    Groups []Group `json:"groups"`
}

type Group struct {
    ID    interface{}    `json:"id"`
    Hits  []SearchResult `json:"hits"`
    Lookup *LookupResult `json:"lookup,omitempty"`
}
```

#### Payload and Vector Controls

Control which vectors and payload fields are returned in the results:

```go
results, err := collection.Query(&QueryRequest{
    Vector: queryVector,
    Limit: 10,
    WithVectors: true,
    WithPayload: []string{"title", "description"},
})
```

Or exclude specific fields:

```go
results, err := collection.Query(&QueryRequest{
    Vector: queryVector,
    Limit: 10,
    WithPayload: map[string]interface{}{
        "exclude": []string{"large_field"},
    },
})
```

### Query Planning & Optimization

Depending on the filter complexity and available indices, the query planner selects the optimal execution strategy:

1. **Filter Cardinality Estimation**:
   - Estimates the number of points that will pass the filter
   - Used to determine whether to use vector or payload indices first

2. **Execution Strategies**:
   - **Full Scan**: Used for small collections or very complex filters
   - **Index-Based**: Utilizes payload indices for efficient filtering
   - **Vector Index First**: Performs similarity search then filters results
   - **Filter First**: Applies filters then performs similarity search on subset

3. **Dynamic Parameter Adjustment**:
   - Automatically adjusts search parameters based on estimated result size
   - For example, increasing `ef` when filtering is expected to exclude many results

4. **Hybrid Execution**:
   - Combines multiple strategies for optimal performance
   - May perform multi-stage search for complex queries

### Implementation Details

Each search strategy is implemented with specialized code paths:

1. **Parameter Optimization**:
   - Each strategy sets different default parameters
   - Users can override specific parameters while keeping strategy benefits

2. **Resource Allocation**:
   - Fast Search: Minimizes memory usage, uses work-stealing thread pool
   - Precise Search: Allocates larger candidate lists, uses dedicated threads
   - Batch Search: Uses partitioned batch processing with vectorized operations

3. **Algorithm Selection**:
   - Dynamically selects best algorithm based on strategy, vector dimension, and dataset size
   - May combine multiple approaches (e.g., initial HNSW followed by exact re-ranking)

4. **Adaptive Behavior**:
   - Tracks query performance metrics per strategy
   - Automatically adjusts parameters based on observed results
   - Provides feedback for potential index optimization

### REST API

The Query API is exposed through a RESTful interface:

```
POST /collections/{collection_name}/points/query
```

Example request:

```json
{
  "vector": [0.2, 0.1, 0.9, 0.7],
  "limit": 10,
  "with_vectors": true,
  "with_payload": true,
  "filter": {
    "must": [
      { "key": "category", "match": { "value": "electronics" } },
      { "key": "price", "range": { "gte": 100, "lte": 500 } }
    ]
  },
  "params": {
    "strategy": "precise",
    "hnsw_ef": 300,
    "score_threshold": 0.7
  }
}
```

For batch queries:

```
POST /collections/{collection_name}/points/query/batch
```

Example batch request:

```json
{
  "searches": [
    {
      "vector": [0.2, 0.1, 0.9, 0.7],
      "limit": 5,
      "params": { "strategy": "fast" }
    },
    {
      "vector": [0.3, 0.8, 0.2, 0.3],
      "limit": 10,
      "params": { "strategy": "precise" }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Partitioning Strategy

### Partitioning Model

The vector store uses a hybrid partitioning approach:

1. **Collection-Level Partitioning**:
   - Each vector collection is treated as a single logical unit
   - Collections are assigned to one or more partitions based on size

2. **Vector-Level Partitioning**:
   - Within large collections, vectors are partitioned using consistent hashing
   - The vector's ID is used as the key for partition assignment
   - Default: 256 virtual nodes per physical node for balanced distribution

3. **Partition Structure**:
   - Each partition has a primary Raft group for consensus
   - Replica count configurable per partition (default: 3 replicas)
   - Independent HNSW indices per partition

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│    Partition Manager    │
├─────────────────────────┤
│ - Consistent hashing    │
│ - Partition assignment  │
│ - Rebalancing logic     │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

### Query Routing

1. **Write Operations**:
   - Client request routed to partition owner based on vector ID
   - If non-owner receives request, forwards to correct partition owner
   - Primary node in Raft group processes the write and replicates

2. **Read Operations**:
   - For ID-based lookups: direct routing to owning partition
   - For similarity searches:
     - Single-partition search if collection is small
     - Multi-partition parallel search with result aggregation for large collections
     - Coordinator node merges results and returns top-K

3. **Rebalancing**:
   - Triggered by node addition/removal or load imbalance
   - Two-phase migration with read-copy-update approach
   - Minimal disruption to ongoing queries during rebalancing

## Data Flow

### Vector Insertion

1. Client sends vector data to a node
2. Node calculates partition ownership based on vector ID
3. If local node is not owner, forwards to correct partition owner
4. Partition owner forwards vector insertion command to Raft leader
5. Raft replicates command to follower nodes
6. Once committed, state machine executes:
   - Persists the vector data
   - Updates the HNSW index (adds node, creates connections in each layer)
   - Updates metadata indices if applicable
7. Acknowledgment returned to client

### Vector Search

1. Client sends query vector and parameters (k, filters, search strategy)
2. Receiving node determines affected partitions:
   - For ID-based retrieval: single partition
   - For similarity search: potentially multiple partitions
3. For each involved partition:
   - If local, performs search using specified strategy
   - If remote, dispatches query to partition owners
4. For multi-partition queries:
   - Parallel execution across partitions
   - Each partition returns top-K local results
   - Coordinator merges results and performs final ranking
5. Results returned to client with distances and metadata

### Vector Deletion

1. Client sends delete request with vector ID
2. Partition owner processes command through Raft
3. Soft deletion applied:
   - Vector marked as deleted but remains in storage
   - Index connections preserved initially
   - Vector excluded from search results
4. Background compaction process periodically:
   - Physically removes deleted vectors
   - Rebuilds affected index regions
   - Reclaims storage space

## Concurrency Model

The vector store implements a multi-level concurrency strategy:

1. **Collection-Level Concurrency**:
   - Reader-writer lock for collection configuration changes
   - Multiple readers can access a collection simultaneously
   - Writer lock acquired for schema changes

2. **Index-Level Concurrency**:
   - Fine-grained layer locks in HNSW structure
   - Lock-free read operations wherever possible
   - Copy-on-write for batch modifications

3. **Vector-Level Concurrency**:
   - Atomic operations for vector updates
   - Optimistic concurrency control with version checking
   - Conflict resolution based on timestamps

4. **Background Operations**:
   - Priority-based scheduling for maintenance tasks
   - Resource throttling to limit impact on foreground operations
   - Cancellable long-running tasks

## Preparing for SOCI Integration

To ensure smooth integration with the eventual Self-Organizing Compact Index (SOCI), we'll implement:

1. **Pluggable Index Interface**:
   - Abstract interface allowing different index implementations
   - Common API for search, insertion, and deletion
   - Enable side-by-side testing of HNSW and SOCI

2. **Telemetry Framework**:
   - Track query patterns and performance metrics
   - Store historical access patterns for future optimization
   - Provide feedback mechanism for self-learning indices

3. **Extensible Graph Structure**:
   - Design HNSW nodes and edges to support future attributes
   - Allow edge weight modifications and quality metrics
   - Prepare for evolutionary adjustments

4. **Vector Quantization Hooks**:
   - Abstract vector storage from index implementation
   - Support prototype-based compression
   - Allow for custom distance approximation

## Testing Strategy
