# Vector Store Layer: Implementation Progress

## 2025-03-10: Initial Implementation Complete

### Summary

The foundational implementation of the vector store layer has been completed. This implementation provides the core data structures, algorithms, and interfaces required for vector storage and similarity search according to the design document. The work represents a significant milestone in building the Nexus-Mind distributed vector database.

### Key Achievements

1. **Core Data Types**
   - Implemented `Vector` and `SparseVector` types for storing embeddings
   - Created `VectorCollection` to manage vectors of the same dimensionality
   - Implemented `MetadataSchema` and comprehensive filtering functionality
   - Added serialization/deserialization support for persistence

2. **Distance Calculations**
   - Implemented multiple distance metrics:
     - Cosine similarity
     - Dot product
     - Euclidean distance
     - Manhattan distance
   - Created SIMD-optimized versions (with placeholders for actual assembly implementations)
   - Added utilities for vector normalization and batch processing
   - Implemented score normalization for consistent ranking

3. **Search Index Framework**
   - Designed and implemented `VectorIndex` interface for pluggable index implementations
   - Created a baseline linear (brute-force) index implementation

     - Default (balanced)
     - Exact search (brute-force)
     - Fast search (optimized for speed)
     - Precise search (optimized for accuracy)
     - Batch search (optimized for throughput)

4. **Universal Query API**
   - Implemented a unified Query API inspired by Qdrant
   - Supported multiple query types:
     - Vector similarity search (kNN)
     - Search by existing point ID (stub)
     - Recommendations by examples (stub)
     - Scrolling through vectors (stub)
     - Random sampling (stub)
   - Added metadata filtering with complex conditions
   - Implemented search parameter optimization based on strategy

5. **REST API Layer**
   - Built a RESTful API exposing vector operations
   - Implemented collection management endpoints
   - Added vector manipulation endpoints
   - Created specialized query endpoints including batch processing
   - Provided grouping functionality

6. **Testing Framework**
   - Added comprehensive unit tests for the linear index
   - Implemented tests for different distance metrics
   - Created test cases for metadata filtering
   - Added benchmarks for performance evaluation
