# Implementation Plan for Filling Gaps in Nexus-Mind

## Current State Analysis

The codebase has a strong distributed systems foundation with:
- A complete Raft consensus implementation
- Sharding framework for horizontal scaling
- Basic key-value store functionality

However, there are major gaps when comparing to the architectural vision:

1. **Missing Vector Storage Layer**: 
   - No vector-specific data structures
   - No similarity search algorithms
   - No HNSW implementation mentioned in ARCHITECTURE.md

2. **No SOCI Implementation**:
   - The SOCI PRD outlines an ambitious self-optimizing index
   - None of the adaptive graph structure or optimization mechanisms exist yet
   - No vector quantization or compression techniques

3. **Absent Query Layer**:
   - Missing vector similarity search capabilities
   - No k-nearest neighbor implementation
   - Lack of metadata filtering

4. **Client Interface Gaps**:
   - No REST API for vector operations
   - Missing bulk import/export functionality

## Proposed Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Vector Functionality
1. **Extend the KV store to support vectors**:
   - Create vector data types and serialization
   - Implement basic vector operations (add, get, delete)
   - Add simple brute-force similarity search as baseline

2. **Basic HNSW Implementation**:
   - Implement the hierarchical navigable small world algorithm
   - Integrate with the existing sharded KV store
   - Add basic similarity metrics (cosine, Euclidean, dot product)

### Phase 2: SOCI Integration
1. **Basic Graph Index**:
   - Implement the core graph structure for SOCI
   - Build basic connectivity mechanisms

2. **Self-Optimization Framework**:
   - Add the feedback collection system
   - Implement basic edge strength adjustments
   - Create the background optimization process

3. **Prototype-Based Compression**:
   - Implement vector quantization techniques
   - Add prototype generation and evolution

### Phase 3: Query Layer & Client Interface
1. **Query Processing**:
   - Implement distributed query execution
   - Add result aggregation and ranking
   - Create metadata filtering capabilities

2. **REST API**:
   - Build comprehensive API endpoints
   - Add authentication and authorization
   - Implement bulk operations

### Implementation Strategy
- Leverage the existing Raft and sharding code as the foundation
- Create a proper abstraction layer between consensus and storage
- Implement thorough testing for each component
- Use metrics to validate against performance requirements

## Timeline and Milestones

### Milestone 1: Basic Vector Storage (2-3 weeks)
- Vector data type implementations
- Basic CRUD operations for vectors
- Initial serialization/deserialization support
- Integration with existing KV store

### Milestone 2: Similarity Search (3-4 weeks)

- SOCI demonstrates performance improvements over time
- System can scale horizontally with minimal performance degradation
- All functionality aligns with the specifications in the PRDs
