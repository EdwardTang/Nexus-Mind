# Future Roadmap for Vector Store

This document outlines the evolution path from MVP to a production-ready system.

## 1. Automated Scaling & Load Balancing

**Current Limitation:** Manual cluster scaling and no automatic data rebalancing

**Future Enhancements:**
- Automated shard rebalancing when nodes join/leave
- Background resharding with minimal performance impact
- Dynamic partition assignment based on node capacity
- Hot-spot detection and mitigation strategies

**Rationale:** Elastic AI workloads demand automated scaling to maintain performance during usage spikes and optimize resource utilization during quiet periods.

## 2. Query Optimization

**Current Limitation:** Basic quorum-based query routing with potential network overhead

**Future Enhancements:**
- Distributed query planning with cost-based optimization
- Intelligent replica selection to minimize network hops
- Query result caching for common similarity searches
- Approximate search options for ultra-low latency use cases

**Rationale:** Complex AI agent workloads require sophisticated query routing to maintain sub-100ms latency at scale.

## 3. Robust Persistence

**Current Limitation:** Simple binary vector storage and serialized HNSW graphs

**Future Enhancements:**
- Write-ahead logging for crash recovery
- Point-in-time recovery capabilities
- Incremental index building for faster recovery
- Tiered storage support (memory, SSD, object storage)
- Snapshot and backup/restore mechanisms

**Rationale:** Production systems need robust data durability guarantees and flexible recovery options.

## 4. Security & Multi-tenancy

**Current Limitation:** Basic API key authentication without encryption

**Future Enhancements:**
- TLS encryption for all communication
- Granular access control with role-based permissions
- Multi-tenant isolation with namespace support
- Data encryption at rest with key rotation
- Audit logging for security compliance

**Rationale:** Multi-agent environments require strong security boundaries and compliance capabilities.

## 5. Observability & Monitoring

**Current Limitation:** Basic logging with limited metrics

**Future Enhancements:**
- Comprehensive metrics for system health
- Distributed tracing for query performance analysis
- Anomaly detection for proactive issue identification
- Visual dashboards for cluster state and workload patterns
- Query profiling and optimization recommendations

**Rationale:** Operating distributed systems at scale requires visibility into performance bottlenecks and failure modes.

## 6. Advanced Vector Indexing

**Current Limitation:** Single HNSW index type

**Future Enhancements:**
- Multiple index type support (IVF, PQ, SCANN)
- Hybrid indexing strategies for different vector dimensions
- Auto-tuning of index parameters based on workload
- Filtered search optimizations

**Rationale:** Different AI applications have varying requirements for recall, precision, and latency.

## 7. Deployment & Integration

**Current Limitation:** Basic deployment with manual configuration

**Future Enhancements:**
- Kubernetes operator for automated management
- Cloud provider integrations (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- SDK libraries for popular AI frameworks
- Simplified migration tools from other vector databases

**Rationale:** Production deployment requires integration with existing infrastructure and developer ecosystems.
