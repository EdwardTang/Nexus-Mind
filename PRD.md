# PRD: MVP Vector Store on Raft-Based Distributed System

## Objective
Build a minimalist Cassandra-inspired vector store system using the Nexus-Mind consensus implementation for metadata coordination while supporting efficient vector similarity search.

## Core Features

1. **Vector Storage & Retrieval**
   - Store embedding vectors (float arrays) with unique IDs
   - Support efficient similarity search (cosine, dot product, Euclidean)
   - Optional document chunk storage alongside vectors

2. **Distributed Architecture**
   - Raft consensus for cluster metadata and topology
   - Consistent hashing for vector partitioning
   - Configurable replication factor

3. **Query Capabilities**
   - Vector similarity search with k-nearest neighbors
   - Basic filtering on metadata
   - Batch vector operations

4. **Client Interface**
   - Simple REST API for CRUD operations
   - Bulk import/export functionality
   - Basic authentication

## Technical Components
- Vector index module (HNSW or similar algorithm)
- Raft-based metadata coordination
- Storage engine for vectors and documents
- Query processor with similarity calculation

## Implementation Phases

### MVP Phase (v0.1)
- **Data Consistency**: Simple Quorum-based consistency mechanism for read/write operations
  - Configurable read/write quorum values
  - Basic conflict resolution using timestamps
  
- **Vector Indexing**: HNSW implementation for efficient similarity search
  - Focus on single index per node initially
  - Optimize for 1536-dimension vectors common in embedding models
  
- **Scalability**: Support basic 3-node cluster configuration
  - Manual node addition/removal process
  - Simple consistent hashing implementation
  
- **Security**: Basic authentication with API keys
  - Simple token validation
  - No encryption in initial phase
  
- **Monitoring**: Fundamental logging system
  - Operation logs for debugging
  - Basic performance metrics collection

### Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Advanced data consistency with CRDT support
- Multiple vector index algorithm options (IVF, PQ, etc.)
- Automatic cluster scaling and rebalancing
- Data encryption and fine-grained access control
- Comprehensive monitoring with alerts and dashboards

## Metrics
- Query latency < 100ms for 10K vectors
- Linear scalability to 3+ nodes
- Support for vectors up to 1536 dimensions
- 99.9% availability target for MVP
